# âš¡ Tesla Fleet to Power Business Opportunity

This project provides a **Streamlit dashboard** that estimates the potential **power trading opportunity** for Tesla, based on its EV fleet growth, battery capacity, and supercharger network expansion.

The app combines **historical sales data**, **battery specifications**, and **forecast parameters** (growth rate, retirement rate, forecast horizon) to project the aggregated fleet capacity (in MWh). It then links this capacity to a simplified business opportunity model.
